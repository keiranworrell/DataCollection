# Data Collection

This repo provides a tool to aid with collecting social network data.
The intention is to extend this tool to be able to then construct the network from the data.

## Use
Upon running the tool, the user will asked which function they would like to run.
The network analysis function is currently *not* implemented.

The user will then be asked for the path to their nodes.csv and edges.csv files.

If these files do not exist, they will be created.
If they do exist but are empty, they will have the correct headings added.
If they do exist and are already populated, the existing data will be imported and can be added to.

A user interface will then be started to give users the choice of recording new characters or interactions between them.
